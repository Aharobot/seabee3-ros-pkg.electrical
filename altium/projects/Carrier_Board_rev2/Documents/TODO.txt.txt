design review points:
--------------------

- "USB_OVCR#" net was deleted (XTX.SchDoc). it's an overcurrent detect input for USB.
    we don't have any overcurrent detection on our board though, or is there
    something you wanted to do with it?
    RAND: I think we should look into pulling this high with a 47k resistor.

----------------------
I will address after design review:
----------------------

1. fix Design Rule check warnings - off grid pins

3. add ground stiching vias.

4. Clean up and arrange top and bottom silkscreens.

5. Get part numbers for every part we are using
